    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This colcannon recipe uses leeks and green cabbage but it tastes equally
      delicious with kale. It is traditional Irish Halloween fare but so
      comforting, it's good anytime!

          Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
          boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 to
          20 minutes. Drain.

          While potatoes are boiling, simmer or steam cabbage in a separate pot
          until tender. Drain and chop; set aside and keep warm.

          Place leeks in a small pot; add just enough milk to cover. Simmer over
          low heat until leeks are soft, about 3 to 5 minutes.

          Season potatoes with salt, pepper, and mace; mash well. Stir in cooked
          leeks and milk. Stir in cabbage and heat through until potatoes are
          pale green in color. Make a well in the center of the colcannon and
          pour in the melted butter. Mix well and serve.
