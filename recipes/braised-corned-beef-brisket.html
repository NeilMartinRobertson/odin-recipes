    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly
      believe you will never go back to the traditionally 'boiled' beef. This
      recipe was given to my mother-in-law and it has become a treasured family
      recipe. The brisket is seared in a hot skillet to give it a caramelized
      surface when it's done, topped with sliced onions, garlic, and a drizzle
      of broth, then braised for about 6 hours for a tender, juicy roast. It's
      so worth the wait! I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges,
      braised carrots, and parsnips. It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish
      dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year round.
