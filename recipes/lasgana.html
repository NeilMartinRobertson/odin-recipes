    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is your classic, deli style lasagne recipe with a rich, beef mince
      filling and a deliciously creamy bechamel sauce.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not the speediest lasagne. You'll need to set aside a couple of hours
      to prepare and cook the sauce, but you will be well rewarded.

          Gently heat the oil in a large frying pan with a lid. Fry the onion
          with a pinch of salt, covered, for 10min, until softened, stirring
          halfway through. Increase heat slightly; add celery and carrot and
          cook, covered, for 10min until softened. Add garlic, tomato purée and
          oregano; cook for 1min.
        </p>

        <p>
          Season mince, break up and add to the pan, stirring until evenly
          browned.

          Add the wine, increase heat and reduce by half. Pour in chopped
          tomatoes. Rinse tin out with hot beef stock and add to the pan. Reduce
          heat and simmer, covered, for 1hr, stirring occasionally. Remove the
          lid for a final 30min to reduce the sauce.

          Heat oven to 180°C (160°C fan) mark 4. Lightly bruise garlic and bay
          leaf.

          For the béchamel, melt the butter in a large, non-stick pan, and then
          add flour, stirringwith a wooden spoon to make a smooth, thick paste.
          Cook, stirring, for 2min. Remove from heat and gradually whisk in milk
          until smooth. Add garlic and bay leaf. Return to heat, bring to boil
          and simmer, stirring, for about 5min until sauce has thickened and
          coats the back of the spoon. Off the heat, remove garlic and bay leaf
          and set aside.

          In a large pan of salted, boiling water, cook pasta for 1min in
          batches to avoid sticking. Set aside to dry on an oiled plate.

          Spread a third of the meat over the base of a 1.6 litre (2¾ pint)
          baking dish about 25.5 x 25.5cm (10 x 10in). Spoon over a quarter of
          the béchamel, sprinkle with 2tbsp Parmesan and place 3 sheets of pasta
          over in a single layer. Repeat twice. Top with the rest of the
          béchamel, then sprinkle over remaining cheese. Season with finely
          ground black pepper. Bake for 35min, until golden.
