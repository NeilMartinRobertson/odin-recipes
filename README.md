In this project, I am showing off basic HTML skills learnt up to this pont
I am doing this by creating a basic recipes site using HTML.
It will be made up of only an index.html page with all of the content on there.
It will be using:
Headings
Paragraphs
Lists - Unordered and Ordered
Nesting Lists
Links
An example use of the sub and sup tag elements
Folder Structure of a webpage

Through this I will enforce the basic knowledge of HTML with it.
